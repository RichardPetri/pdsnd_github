# Python bikeshare project

### Description
This python script lets you explore the bikeshare data from three cities stored in the corresponding .csv files (not included in the remote repository).
You can choose the **city** and have the filter options by: **month** and **day of week**. After choosing those, the script lets you explore the **raw data**, if you choose so. You can also start over again.

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
* chicago.csv

### Credits
To help me figure out how to only output the value for mode() without the rest of the info, I used this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42885332/uncomfortable-output-of-mode-in-pandas-dataframe).

Also, I used the practice solutions for load_data, mode() and user breakdown from the Udacity Python Project.
